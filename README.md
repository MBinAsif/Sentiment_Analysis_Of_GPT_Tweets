#import pandas as pd` is importing the pandas library and assigning it the alias `pd`. This allows the user to refer to the pandas library using the shorter name `pd` instead of typing out the full name `pandas` every time it is used in the code.

#nrows = 1000 to onlu load specific numbrt of rows
#`df = pd.read_csv('gdrive/My Drive/Twitter.csv')` is reading a CSV file named "Twitter.csv" located in the "My Drive" folder of the Google Drive and storing its contents in a pandas DataFrame called "df".

#`df.dropna(inplace=True)` is a method in pandas that removes any rows with missing values (NaN) from the DataFrame. The `inplace=True` parameter ensures that the changes are made to the original DataFrame rather than creating a new one.

`df.info()` is a method in pandas that provides a summary of the DataFrame including the number of non-null values, data type, and memory usage. It is useful for quickly understanding the structure and content of the DataFrame.

# Get the column names
#`columns = df.columns.tolist()` is creating a list of column names from the DataFrame `df` and assigning it to the variable `columns`. The `tolist()` method is used to convert the column names from a pandas Index object to a Python list.

# Swap the positions of column 1 and column 2
#`columns[1], columns[2] = columns[2], columns[1]` is swapping the positions of the second and third elements in the `columns` list. It is using tuple unpacking to assign the value of `columns[2]` to `columns[1]` and the value of `columns[1]` to `columns[2]`.

# Reorder the columns in the DataFrame

#`average_b = df['like_count'].mean()` is calculating the mean (average) value of the 'like_count' column in the DataFrame 'df' and assigning it to the variable 'average_b'.

#`unique_values = set(df['like_count'])` is creating a set of unique values from the 'like_count' column of the DataFrame `df`. The set() function removes any duplicate values and returns only the unique values in the column.
#`print("Unique values in the 'like_count' column:")` is printing a message to the console indicating that the following output will display the unique values in the 'like_count' column of the DataFrame.

# Group by 'like_count' and calculate the sum of 'retweet_count'
#This code is grouping the data in the DataFrame 'df' by the values in the 'like_count' column and then calculating the sum of the 'retweet_count' column for each group. The resulting object 'grouped_data' is a Series object with the 'like_count' values as the index and the sum of 'retweet_count' values as the values.

#This code is grouping the data in the DataFrame `df` by the values in the column 'like_count', and then calculating the mean of the values in the column 'retweet_count' for each group. The resulting object `grouped_data1` is a Series where the index is the unique values in the 'like_count' column and the values are the mean of the corresponding 'retweet_count' values for each group.

#`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` is importing the `pyplot` module from the `matplotlib` library and giving it an alias `plt`. This allows us to use the functions and methods provided by the `pyplot` module using the shorter alias `plt`.

#`from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder` is importing the `LabelEncoder` class from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module. The `LabelEncoder` class is used to encode categorical variables as integers, which can be useful for machine learning algorithms that require numerical inputs.

#`LE = LabelEncoder()` creates an instance of the `LabelEncoder` class from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module. This class is used to encode categorical variables as integers.
#`df['Level_encoded'] = LE.fit_transform(df['username'])` is creating a new column in the DataFrame `df` called `'Level_encoded'` and populating it with the encoded values of the `'username'` column using the `fit_transform()` method of the `LabelEncoder` object `LE`. The encoded values are integers representing the unique categories in the `'username'` column.
#`df[['Level_encoded', 'username']]` is selecting the columns `'Level_encoded'` and `'username'` from the DataFrame `df` and displaying them. This is useful for checking the encoding of the categorical variable `'username'` using the `LabelEncoder` class.
#`df['Level_encoded1'] = LE.fit_transform(df['content'])` is creating a new column in the DataFrame `df` called `'Level_encoded1'` and populating it with the encoded values of the `'content'` column using the `fit_transform()` method of the `LabelEncoder` object `LE`. The encoded values are integers representing the unique categories in the `'content'` column.
#`df[['Level_encoded1', 'content']]` is selecting the columns `'Level_encoded1'` and `'content'` from the DataFrame `df` and displaying them. This is useful for checking the encoding of the categorical variable `'content'` using the `LabelEncoder` class.


#`plt.bar(grouped_data.index, grouped_data.values)` is creating a bar chart using the index values of the `grouped_data` DataFrame as the x-axis and the values of the `grouped_data` DataFrame as the y-axis. Each bar represents a level_encoded value and its corresponding like_count value.
#`plt.xlabel('Level_encoded')` is setting the label for the x-axis of the bar chart to "Level_encoded".
#`plt.ylabel('like_count')` is setting the label for the y-axis as "like_count" in the plot.
#`plt.title('User Like')` is setting the title of the bar chart to "User Like".
#`plt.xticks(rotation=45)` is rotating the x-axis tick labels by 45 degrees to prevent overlapping of the labels and make them more readable.

# Set the y-axis limits
# Set the x-axis limits

#`df.tail()` is a method used in pandas library to display the last n rows of a DataFrame. By default, it displays the last 5 rows of the DataFrame.
#`df.describe()` is a method in pandas library that provides descriptive statistics of a DataFrame. It includes count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values for each column in the DataFrame.
#`df.index` is accessing the index of a pandas DataFrame `df`. It returns the index labels of the rows in the DataFrame.
#`df.dtypes` is a method used to display the data type of each column in a pandas DataFrame `df`. It returns a Series with the data type of each column.
#`df.value_counts()` is a method in pandas library that returns a series containing counts of unique values in a dataframe. It is used to get a count of each unique value in a column of a dataframe.
#`df.nunique()` is a method in pandas library that returns the number of unique values for each column in a DataFrame. It is used to get an idea of the number of distinct values in each column of a DataFrame.

#This line of code is importing the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` class from the `nltk.sentiment` module. The `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` is a pre-trained model that can be used to analyze the sentiment of a given text.
#`import string` is importing the built-in Python module `string`, which provides a collection of string constants and functions that are commonly used in Python programming. This module includes constants such as `string.ascii_letters`, `string.digits`, and `string.punctuation`, as well as functions like `string.capwords()` and `string.Template()`.
#`import nltk` is importing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) module, which is a popular Python library used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.
#`from nltk.corpus import stopwords` is importing the `stopwords` module from the NLTK corpus. This module contains a list of common words that are often removed from text during natural language processing tasks, such as articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.
#`from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer` is importing the `PorterStemmer` class from the `stem` module of the NLTK library. The `PorterStemmer` is a widely used algorithm for stemming words in natural language processing. Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form, which can help with tasks such as text classification and information retrieval.
#`nltk.download('stopwords')` downloads the stopwords corpus from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. Stopwords are common words that are often removed from text data during preprocessing because they do not carry much meaning or significance in the analysis.
